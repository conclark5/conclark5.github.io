        <p class="bologna-body">Bologna was very cool and budding with a large young population. It had a very active night life and tons of college aged kids mulling around and drinking. The center of Bologna holds two towers, it is somewhat famous and what the city is known for. Where we stayed looked right out on these towers and was right in the center of the city. It had a very cool morning cafe right next to us, a lot of trendy restaurants for lunch and dinner, and good shopping. This is where we went after Venice, it took about two and a half hours to get there by train. One of the great things about this trip was being able to train from city to city. It makes travel fairly easy and lets you enjoy the scenery as you travel at high speeds.</p>

            <figcaption class="bologna-caption01">The Two Towers in Bologna are the city's most iconic landmark. They rise high above anything else in the city and are from medieval times. This was the view we had from our room in the city center, the sunset and sunrise both looked beautiful with these structures in the foreground.</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="bologna-caption02">You actually have the opportunity to travel up the taller of two towers. It was about 500 steps to the top and an absolutely claustrophobic set of winding stairs all the way there. It was hands-down worth the climb as the layout of all of Bologna beneath was marvelous.</figcaption>
