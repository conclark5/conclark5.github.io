        <p>Italy is a beautiful country and I spent the last two weeks of the summer there with my family. We went to multiple parts and saw many different signts. Starting in Venice, we trained to Bologna, then to a city called La Spezia, from there we went to Salerno, and finaly Rome. All throughout the trip we went to different locations near where we were staying, in La Spezia we went to a chain of five amazing cities called Cinque Terre, in Salerno we went along the stunning Amalfi Coast, and after that we went to the absoulete jaw-dropping island of Capri. I took plenty of amazing pictures on my vacation and would love an opportunity to share them and give thought to them.</p>
