        <h1>Italy</h1>
        <p>Italy is a beautiful country and I spent the last two weeks of the summer there with my family. We went to multiple parts of Italy. Starting in Venice, we trained to Bologna, then to a city called La Spezia, then to Salerno, and finaly Rome. All throughout the trip we went to different locations near where we were staying, in La Spezia we went to a chain of five amazing cities called Cinque Terre, in Salerno we went along the stunning Amalfi Coast, and after that we went to the absoulete jaw-dropping island of Capri. I took plenty of amazing pictures on my vacation and would love an opportunity to share them and give thought to them.</p>
