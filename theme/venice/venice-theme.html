        <p class="venice-body">We started our trip off in Venice, we stayed here for 3 days before going to our next destination. We spent the days traveling around on a water taxi that takes you to, and from and several locations throughout the Venetian Lagoon. Since there are no roads, only canals and open water, boats are the primary mode of transportation. We also took a personal gondola tour around the island of Venice, and toured around on foot. We tried our first, true Italian pizza and gelato here as well.</p>
