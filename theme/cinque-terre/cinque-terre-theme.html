        <p class="terre-body">Cinque Terre was absolutely mind-blowing. These five cities are settled along the coast, connected by train tracks, and that's the only way to enter or exit except by boat. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has banned all cars, you can walk between each city if the weather permits, and the trails are clear. Unfortunatley, as of recent the trails have been ruined from weather and it is very difficult to walk between. Each city was unique and each was breathtaking, they all had absolutely spectacular views and are an absolute must-see. We went to four of five cities as we were too tired, and it was too dark to go to the last one.</p>

            <figcaption class="terre-caption01">This is a picture of the beach and city area of the first city, Monterosso. It had a few trails we walked along that had some spectacular views, and amazing pictures. The water was crazy clear, even from all the way up here.</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="terre-caption02">This picture was also taken from Monterosso. The statue of the man and his dog was very cool and made for a very good picture. The coastline just looks spectacular, probably what the man is showing his dog.</figcaption>

            <img class="terre03" src="IMG_1531.jpg" alt="This is from the second city called, Vernazza.">
            <figcaption class="terre-caption03">This was taken at the second city we went to, Vernazza. This city required a lot of walking to get this picture, but it was one of the best pictures I got from this vacation. I love the way that the city juts out in a peninsula shape, high above the water. I also liked the two towers seen in this.</figcaption>

            <img class="terre04" src="IMG_1587.jpg" alt="This was from the fourth city we went to, Manarola.">
            <figcaption class="terre-caption04">This picture was taken from the fourth city that we went to, Manarola. This island was very cool, they designed it on a large hill that goes all the way down to the water and into it. The residents will put their boats on dolly's then wheel them down the hill and into the water for the day. At night they load the boats on to the dolly's again and take them out of the water, and wheel them back up the hill. We got to catch the sunset here which was definitley not one to miss.</figcaption>
