        <p class="intro-format">My name is Connor Clark and this is my 3rd year at BC, I did running start for the last 2 years and just graduated high school. I have no experience with Programming so this is my first dive into the content. I hope to learn something new and see if it interests me and I have an aptitude for it or if it's just something that's too complicated for me. I have an Alexa device at home that my parents don't really care listens in but I care. I don't really know why but I would just rather it not store my information.</p>
