        <p class="intro-format">This is a site based off of the theme of Italy. I just recently took a trip there for about two weeks with my family. This is a collection of pictures I took and a little about the places we went. I am really glad I had the experience and I think it opened my eyes to new places I want to go, and opportunities for my future. I would highly reccomend a trip to Italy, the sights are unbeatable, as is the food!</p>
