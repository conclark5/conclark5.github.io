        <p>One of the best places we went to was the island of Capri, off of the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy. We took a boat from a city called Salerno, that took us around the entirety of the island, which was absolutely spectacular. The rock of the island was crazy, forming endless stalacites, and numerous grottos and caves. The island sits in the Adriatic Sea, the water was extremely blue and clear around the island, and was the naturally warmest body of water I have ever swam in. The water felt like a pool, with the exception of the salt. Around the island there were an absoultely astonishing amount of mansions, what dream that would be.</p>
