        <p class="capri-body">One of the best places we went to, was the island of Capri, which is located inside the Gulf of Naples in Southern Italy. We took a boat from a city called Sorrento, that took us around the entirety of the island, which was absolutely spectacular. The rock of the island was crazy, forming endless stalacites, and numerous grottos and caves. The island sits in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the water was extremely blue and clear around the island, and was the naturally warmest body of water I have ever swam in. The water felt like a pool, with the exception of the salt. Around the island there was an absoultely astonishing amount of mansions, what a dream that would be.</p>

            <figcaption class="capri-caption01">The boat ride to the island was spectacular, we were on a large catamaran so it just cut through the rough sea waves like they were nothing. It was extremely smooth, the views were beautiful of the coast line and of the island. When we got to the island this idyllic scene was ours to explore.</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="capri-caption02">This is a picture from the catamaran when we were going around the island. The rocks are called, "Faraglioni," they are stacks that stand above the water. Our catamaran went through the one with the hole in the middle of it. These were spectacular as was the rest of the coast line of this island.</figcaption>

            <figcaption class="capri-caption03">When you get to the island you come into the main dock at the lower part of the island in the picture. You can explore that area as there's much to do, but you can also come up to where this picture was taken. There is a tram system that takes groups of people up and down the large hill face of the mountain. When you get to the top there is an unforgettable view and numerous shops, restaurants, and gardens to explore.</figcaption>
